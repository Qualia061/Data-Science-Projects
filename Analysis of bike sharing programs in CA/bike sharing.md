# Visual Analysis of Bike Sharing Programs in CA

## Description
Bike sharing programs have become popular in big cities over the last decade. In the most common arrangement,
customers can rent a bike from an automated ”dock” and return it later to any other dock in the city. The
charge the customer is based on how long they used the bike.
The largest bike sharing program in the United States is in New York City, but bike shares have also recently
formed in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. The bike sharing programs in many cities publish
anonymized data about trips and stations.
